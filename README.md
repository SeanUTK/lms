We need to output a new README.md containing:
• Project description of TMS Pro, overview, feature list per module.
• Technology stack: React/TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Supabase, Mapbox, Recharts, Vite.
• Setup instructions: prerequisites, clone, env file, install, run (frontend vite). Supabase: create project, copy env vars, SQL schema migration pointer or Supabase Studio.
• Mapbox config.
• Development guidelines: repo structure, code style (Prettier/ESLint), Git flow, commit convention, branch naming, using env flags.
• Running tests (placeholder), lint, build.
• Deployment: Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Supabase hosted backend, .env production, CI/CD (GitHub Actions) pointers, monitoring.
• Contribution guidelines and license summary.

Leverage earlier reasoning chain about modules, color scheme etc. Provide comprehensive list of modules: Dashboard, Dispatching, Accounting, Fleet, Safety, Account Resources, Reports, Notifications.

Include quick start commands.

Only output README.md content inside facFileContent.
